In this paper, various existing frameworks for face data augmentation are reviewed with a strong emphasis on GANs
which have been reognized as more powerful and effective than traditional tools. Additionally, various evaluation
metrics for looking at the quality of augmentation are discussed. Lastly, some important challenges in the
task of face data augmentation are pointed out as well.
