b) Read https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification (Links to an external site.) 

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner (Links to an external site.)

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/advanced (Links to an external site.)

Redo the keras  colab for another task :

https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/keras/classification.ipynb (Links to an external site.)

 
Publish all the colabs you write from scratch to github (DO NOT JUST COPY COLABS FROM ABOVE AND PASTE).
